      <h2>Wolf</h2>
      <p>
        Wolves are some of the most iconic predators in the animal kingdom.
        They’re featured in songs, legends, and even modern films. Although the
        gray wolf is the most recognizable, there are more than 30 distinct
        subspecies that range across the northern hemisphere. These dedicated
        pack animals hunt together, roam together, and play together, all while
        maintaining an important role in their local ecosystem.

          <h3>Himalayan wolf</h3>
          <p>
            Himalayan wolf is a distinct species of wolf,which shows unique
            genetic adaptation to the difficult conditions in the Asian high
            altitude ecosystems, found a study, reiterating that it needs to be
            identified as a species of special conservation concern.
            “Conservation action for the Himalayan wolf is required and of
            global conservation interest,” noted the study.

          <h3>Gray wolf</h3>
          <p>
            The gray wolf is a species of carnivorous canine from which descend
            many subspecies. At present, this species is mainly distributed
            throughout the United States of America where it is one of the
            largest natural wild predators. They are also known as the timber
            wolf.

          <h3>Arctic wolf</h3>
          <p>
            Heading to slightly colder climes, we find the Arctic wolf. This
            specimen only lives in Canada and Greenland. Its size is smaller
            than that of other wolves, weighing around 45 kilos in most cases.
            As a way of adapting to its cold environment, the Arctic wolf has a
            white to yellowish coat which allows them to blend more easily into
            their surroundings. The Arctic wolf is a subspecies of the gray
            wolf.
